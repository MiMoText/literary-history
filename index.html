::
- Collaborative project
- Funded for 3 years by the regional government
- Key question: 
  - How can make the most out of digital methods for Literary History today?

## The MiMoText Project


---
#### Context: Trier Center for Digital Humanities
<a href="img/tcdh.jpg"><img height="480" data-src="img/tcdh.jpg"></a>
<p><a href="https://tcdh.uni-trier.de">tcdh.uni-trier.de</a></p>

::
- "MiMoText" is a project located at the TCDH, Trier University, Germany
- The TCDH has been founded in 1998 and is one of the oldest DH centers in Europe
- Our areas of specialty include: 
  - scholarly digital editions
  - digital lexicography
  - research software
  - and computational literary studies.
- The MiMoText project is part of the CLS research area


---
#### MiMoText: overview
<a href="img/mimotext-overview_eng.png"><img height="300" data-src="img/mimotext-overview_eng.png"></a>
<br/>
1. Bibliographies: metadata modeling
2. Primary Texts: analysis results
3. Scholarly Publications: statement extraction
4. Methods of Analysis (Machine Learning)


::
- Our key goal is to provide a dense network of information for literary history
- We aim to create a model for a "wikidata for literary history"
- More importantly, our goal is to develop the methods and models needed to do this on a large scale
- We currently focus on 18th-century French literature
- What we need to build such an information network is: 
- (A) Three sources of information
  - Bibliographies: metadata modeling
  - Primary texts: novels; results from quantitative analysis
  - Scholarly publications (literary histories): statment extraction
- (B) You also need
  - A Data Model (Ontology, Data structure)
  - Methods of Analysis (Annotation, Machine Learning)
  

---
#### Smart Data, Smart Modeling
<a href="img/story-of-smart-big-data.png"><img height="480" src="img/story-of-smart-big-data.png"></img></a>
<p>Schöch, "Big? Smart? Clean? Messy? Data in the Humanities" (2013)</p>

::
- With this project, we believe that we can contribute to a "third way" for DH: 
- Not concerned with "small data": scholarly editions
- Not concerned  big data: deep learning)
- Instead, a third way:
  - mid-sized, somewhat-structured datasets
  - richly, but automatically, annotated text corpora
  - allowing sophisticated information retrieval methods and queries
  - allowing for analyses far beyond the canon of famous literary texts; but still focused on the literary domain
- Similar to the rich databases of historical information important in Asian DH (as far as I can tell)
  - Based on full text and automatic information extraction
  - We operate in the Linked Open Data paradigm (not Databases)
  - Focused on literary studies (rather than History)


--
## (1) Metadata (Bibliographies)

---
#### *Bibliographie du genre romanesque* : Candide
<a href="img/bgrf-Candide.png"><img height="450" src="img/bgrf-Candide.png"></img></a>
<p>Martin / Mylne / Frautschi: <em>Bibliographie<br/>du genre romanesque français, 1751-1800</em>, 1977</p>

::
- An example entry in the printed bibliography
- ~2600 such entries (novels)
- carefully-curated data, published in 1997
- defines our population: all novels ever published in the period


---
#### *Bibliographie* modeled as RDF
<a href="img/bgrf-Diderot-RDF.png"><img height="500" src="img/bgrf-Diderot-RDF.png"></img></a>

::
- This is how this looks like when modeled in RDF (as Linked Open Data)
- The data is modeled using Dublin Core and the SPAR family of ontologies
- Contains about 58.000 triples (22 per novel)
- Includes statements about the content, plot, setting, protagonists of many of the novels (!)


--
## (2) Primary Sources


---
#### The "roman18" corpus
<img height="400" src="img/roman18.jpg"></img>
<br/><p><em>Collection of Eighteenth-Century French Novels (1750-1800)</em></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/MiMoText/roman18">github.com/MiMoText/roman18</a></p>

::
- Corpus size: currently 96 volumes (work in progress)
- Not a representative sample (random sample of population)
- Rather, balanced for a few key criteria
  - decade of writing (1750-1800)
  - type of narration (memoirs, third-person, epistolary, dialogue)
  - male and female authors


---
#### The "roman18" corpus: digitization
<img height="300" src="img/laure.jpg"></img>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img height="300" src="img/laure1.jpg"></img>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img height="300" src="img/zely.jpg"></img>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="img/zely1.jpg"><img height="300" src="img/zely1.jpg"></img></a>

* Most important source: French National Library (PDF scans)
* Full-text digitization (Double Keying, OCR model)
* Simple encoding in XML-TEI (ELTeC schema)

---
#### Topic Modeling: Two major topics
<br/>
"monarchy" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "love"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br/><img height="250" src="img/topic_002.png"></img>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img height="250" src="img/topic_009.png"></img>

* Derived example statements 
  * Candide ABOUT "monarchy"
  * Clarice ABOUT "love"

## (3) Scholarly Publications

---
#### Statement Extraction
1. Named Entity Recognition (automatically)
2. Statement Annotation (manually, to create training data; shown here)
3. Statement Extraction (using Machine Learning, based on training data)


---
#### Named Entity Recognition
><span style="background-color:yellow">Candide [WORK]</span> is <span style="background-color:yellow">Voltaire's [PERS]</span> most widely read work, and was probably already during <span style="background-color:yellow">the author's [PERS]</span> lifetime. When <span style="background-color:yellow">it [WORK]</span> first appeared in print in <span style="background-color:yellow">Geneva [LOC]</span> in <span style="background-color:yellow">1759 [TIME]</span>, it was immediately banned, but only with the result that it was reprinted thirteen times in the same year. (Köhler)

* Recognition results (spaCy, F1-score)
  * PERS: 0.864-0.917 
  * LOC: 0.829-0.837
  * WORK: 0.451-0.497

---
#### Statement Annotation
<img height="250" src="img/inception_Candide-disambiguation.png"></img>
<img height="250" src="img/inception_genre.png"></img>

::
- Second step: Statement Annotation
- To improve the Named Entity Recognition (here, at the top: disambiguation)
- To generate training data (here, at the bottom: "Bélisaire HAS_GENRE novel"

## Bringing it all together



---
#### LOD about *Candide*: metadata
<img height="500" data-src="img/Knowledge-Graph_Beispiel1_Candide_22-11-20.png">

::
- LOD: enables us to think in terms of minimal statements
- Statements consist of atomic units: subject, predicate, object
- The key challenge is in the underlying, subject-specific ontology


---
#### LOD about *Candide*: ABOUT
<img height="500" data-src="img/network-of-information_TopMod_291020c.png">

::
- Another network, focused on the themes in Candide
  - ABOUT statements can be derived from the bibliography, from primary sources, from scholarly publications
  - The labels for these ABOUT statments come from a fixed vocabulary we designed
  - Each ABOUT statement has a specific source: a model, a publication, etc.
  - The sources need to be represented in the model as well
- This network forms the basis of our "Wikidata for Literary History"
  - Users can browse, search, and query using SPARQL queries
  - For literary historians, this will just be the beginning, of course! 
  - A new way of distant reading and literary history
  - Doesn't aim to tell a particular story
  - It leaves the challenge of creating such a story to each user. 
- Thank you!
